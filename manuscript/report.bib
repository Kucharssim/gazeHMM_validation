abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are flexible time series models in which the distribution of the observations depends on unobserved serially correlated states. The state-dependent distributions in HMMs are usually taken from some class of parametrically specified distributions. The choice of this class can be difficult, and an unfortunate choice can have serious consequences for example on state estimates, and more generally on the resulting model complexity and interpretation. We demonstrate these practical issues in a real data application concerned with vertical speeds of a diving beaked whale, where we demonstrate that parametric approaches can easily lead to overly complex state processes, impeding meaningful biological inference. In contrast, for the dive data, HMMs with nonparametrically estimated state-dependent distributions are much more parsimonious in terms of the number of states and easier to interpret, while fitting the data equally well. Our nonparametric estimation approach is based on the idea of representing the densities of the state-dependent distributions as linear combinations of a large number of standardized B-spline basis functions, imposing a penalty term on non-smoothness in order to maintain a good balance between goodness-of-fit and smoothness.},

abstract = {A novel algorithm for detection of saccades and postsaccadic oscillations in the presence of smooth pursuit movements is proposed. The method combines saccade detection in the acceleration domain with specialized on-and offset criteria for saccades and postsaccadic oscillations. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by comparing the detection results to those of an existing velocity-based adaptive algorithm and a manually annotated database. The results show that there is a good agreement between the events detected by the proposed algorithm and those in the annotated database with Cohen's kappa around 0.8 for both a development and a test database. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm accurately detects saccades and postsaccadic oscillations as well as intervals of disturbances. {\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Clustering time-series data into discrete groups can improve prediction and provide insight into the nature of underlying, unobservable states of the system. However, temporal variation in probabilities of group occupancy, or the rates at which individuals move between groups, can obscure such signals. We use finite mixture and hidden Markov models (HMMs), two standard clustering techniques, to model long-term hourly movement data from Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi). Allowing for temporal heterogeneity in transition probabilities, a straightforward but little-used extension of the standard HMM framework, resolves some shortcomings of current models and clarifies the movement patterns of panthers. Results: Simulations and analyses of panther data showed that model misspecification (omitting important sources of variation) can lead to overfitting/overestimating the underlying number of movement states. Models incorporating temporal heterogeneity identify fewer underlying states, and can make out-of-sample predictions that capture observed diurnal and autocorrelated movement patterns exhibited by Florida panthers. Conclusion: Incorporating temporal heterogeneity improved goodness of fit and predictive capability as well as reducing the selected number of movement states closer to a biologically interpretable level, although there is further room for improvement here. Our results suggest that incorporating additional structure in statistical models of movement can allow more accurate assessment of appropriate model complexity.},

abstract = {An eye tracker makes it possible to record the gaze point of a person looking at for example a computer monitor. Modern techniques are very flexible and allow the user to behave naturally without the need of cumbersome equipment such as special contact lenses or electrical probes. This is valuable in psychological research, marketing research and Human Computer Interaction. Eye trackers also give people who are severely paralyzed and unable to type and speak means to communicate using their eyes. Measurement noise makes the use of digital filters necessary. An example is an eye-controlled cursor for a desktop environment such as Windows. The cursor has to be stable enough to allow the user to select folders, icons or other items of interest. While this type of application requires a fast real-time filter, others are less sensitive to processing time but demand an even higher level of accuracy. This work explores three areas of eye tracking filtration and aims at enhancing the performance of the filters used in the eye tracking systems built by Tobii Technology, Sweden. First, a post-processing algorithm to find fixations in raw gaze data is detailed. Second, modifications to an existing reading detection algorithm are described to make it more robust to natural irregularities in reading patterns. Third, a real-time filter for an eye-controlled cursor to be used in a desktop environment is designed using a low-pass filter in parallel with a change detector. The fixation filter produced fewer false fixations and was also able to detect fixations lying spatially closer together than the previously used filter. The reading detection algorithm was shown to be robust to natural irregularities in reading such as revisits to previously read text or skipped paragraphs. The eye-cursor filter proved to respond quicker than the previously used moving average filter while maintaining a high level of noise attenuation.},

Extensive simulations are used to demonstrate the reasons that render order selection particularly challenging in practice despite the conceptual simplicity of the task. In particular, we demonstrate why well-established formal procedures for model selection, such as those based on standard information criteria, tend to favor models with numbers of states that are undesirably large in situations where states shall be meaningful entities. We also offer a pragmatic step-by-step approach together with comprehensive advice for how practitioners can implement order selection. Our proposed strategy is illustrated with a real-data case study on muskox movement. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.},

@article{Savitzky1964,
abstract = {In attempting to analyze, on digital computers, data from basically continuous physical experiments, numerical methods of performing familiar operations must be developed. The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the FORTRAN language. {\textcopyright} 1964, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},
