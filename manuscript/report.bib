abstract = {A novel algorithm for detection of saccades and postsaccadic oscillations in the presence of smooth pursuit movements is proposed. The method combines saccade detection in the acceleration domain with specialized on-and offset criteria for saccades and postsaccadic oscillations. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by comparing the detection results to those of an existing velocity-based adaptive algorithm and a manually annotated database. The results show that there is a good agreement between the events detected by the proposed algorithm and those in the annotated database with Cohen's kappa around 0.8 for both a development and a test database. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm accurately detects saccades and postsaccadic oscillations as well as intervals of disturbances. {\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.},

@phdthesis{Olsson2007,
abstract = {An eye tracker makes it possible to record the gaze point of a person looking at for example a computer monitor. Modern techniques are very flexible and allow the user to behave naturally without the need of cumbersome equipment such as special contact lenses or electrical probes. This is valuable in psychological research, marketing research and Human Computer Interaction. Eye trackers also give people who are severely paralyzed and unable to type and speak means to communicate using their eyes. Measurement noise makes the use of digital filters necessary. An example is an eye-controlled cursor for a desktop environment such as Windows. The cursor has to be stable enough to allow the user to select folders, icons or other items of interest. While this type of application requires a fast real-time filter, others are less sensitive to processing time but demand an even higher level of accuracy. This work explores three areas of eye tracking filtration and aims at enhancing the performance of the filters used in the eye tracking systems built by Tobii Technology, Sweden. First, a post-processing algorithm to find fixations in raw gaze data is detailed. Second, modifications to an existing reading detection algorithm are described to make it more robust to natural irregularities in reading patterns. Third, a real-time filter for an eye-controlled cursor to be used in a desktop environment is designed using a low-pass filter in parallel with a change detector. The fixation filter produced fewer false fixations and was also able to detect fixations lying spatially closer together than the previously used filter. The reading detection algorithm was shown to be robust to natural irregularities in reading such as revisits to previously read text or skipped paragraphs. The eye-cursor filter proved to respond quicker than the previously used moving average filter while maintaining a high level of noise attenuation.},

@article{Savitzky1964,
abstract = {In attempting to analyze, on digital computers, data from basically continuous physical experiments, numerical methods of performing familiar operations must be developed. The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the FORTRAN language. {\textcopyright} 1964, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},
