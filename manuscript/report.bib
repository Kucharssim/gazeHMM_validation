Analysis often proceeds by first selecting the best model according to some criterion and then learning about the parameters of this selected model. Crucially, however, in this approach the parameter estimates are conditioned on the selected model, and any uncertainty about the model-selection process is ignored. An alternative is to learn the parameters for all candidate models and then combine the estimates according to the posterior probabilities of the associated models. This approach is known as Bayesian model averaging (BMA). BMA has several important advantages over all-or-none selection methods, but has been used only sparingly in the social sciences. In this conceptual introduction, we explain the principles of BMA, describe its advantages over all-or-none model selection, and showcase its utility in three examples: analysis of covariance, meta-analysis, and network analysis.},

The state-dependent distributions in HMMs are usually taken from some class of parametrically specified distributions. The choice of this class can be difficult, and an unfortunate choice can have serious consequences for example on state estimates, and more generally on the resulting model complexity and interpretation. We demonstrate these practical issues in a real data application concerned with vertical speeds of a diving beaked whale, where we demonstrate that parametric approaches can easily lead to overly complex state processes, impeding meaningful biological inference. In contrast, for the dive data, HMMs with nonparametrically estimated state-dependent distributions are much more parsimonious in terms of the number of states and easier to interpret, while fitting the data equally well. Our nonparametric estimation approach is based on the idea of representing the densities of the state-dependent distributions as linear combinations of a large number of standardized B-spline basis functions, imposing a penalty term on non-smoothness in order to maintain a good balance between goodness-of-fit and smoothness.},

The method combines saccade detection in the acceleration domain with specialized on-and offset criteria for saccades and postsaccadic oscillations. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by comparing the detection results to those of an existing velocity-based adaptive algorithm and a manually annotated database. The results show that there is a good agreement between the events detected by the proposed algorithm and those in the annotated database with Cohen's kappa around 0.8 for both a development and a test database. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm accurately detects saccades and postsaccadic oscillations as well as intervals of disturbances. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Clustering time-series data into discrete groups can improve prediction and provide insight into the nature of underlying, unobservable states of the system. However, temporal variation in probabilities of group occupancy, or the rates at which individuals move between groups, can obscure such signals. We use finite mixture and hidden Markov models (HMMs), two standard clustering techniques, to model long-term hourly movement data from Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi). Allowing for temporal heterogeneity in transition probabilities, a straightforward but little-used extension of the standard HMM framework, resolves some shortcomings of current models and clarifies the movement patterns of panthers. Results: Simulations and analyses of panther data showed that model misspecification (omitting important sources of variation) can lead to overfitting/overestimating the underlying number of movement states. Models incorporating temporal heterogeneity identify fewer underlying states, and can make out-of-sample predictions that capture observed diurnal and autocorrelated movement patterns exhibited by Florida panthers. Conclusion: Incorporating temporal heterogeneity improved goodness of fit and predictive capability as well as reducing the selected number of movement states closer to a biologically interpretable level, although there is further room for improvement here. Our results suggest that incorporating additional structure in statistical models of movement can allow more accurate assessment of appropriate model complexity.},

	abstract = {An eye tracker makes it possible to record the gaze point of a person looking at for example a computer monitor. Modern techniques are very flexible and allow the user to behave naturally without the need of cumbersome equipment such as special contact lenses or electrical probes. This is valuable in psychological research, marketing research and Human Computer Interaction. Eye trackers also give people who are severely paralyzed and unable to type and speak means to communicate using their eyes. Measurement noise makes the use of digital filters necessary. An example is an eye-controlled cursor for a desktop environment such as Windows. The cursor has to be stable enough to allow the user to select folders, icons or other items of interest. While this type of application requires a fast real-time filter, others are less sensitive to processing time but demand an even higher level of accuracy. This work explores three areas of eye tracking filtration and aims at enhancing the performance of the filters used in the eye tracking systems built by Tobii Technology, Sweden. First, a post-processing algorithm to find fixations in raw gaze data is detailed. Second, modifications to an existing reading detection algorithm are described to make it more robust to natural irregularities in reading patterns. Third, a real-time filter for an eye-controlled cursor to be used in a desktop environment is designed using a low-pass filter in parallel with a change detector. The fixation filter produced fewer false fixations and was also able to detect fixations lying spatially closer together than the previously used filter. The reading detection algorithm was shown to be robust to natural irregularities in reading such as revisits to previously read text or skipped paragraphs. The eye-cursor filter proved to respond quicker than the previously used moving average filter while maintaining a high level of noise attenuation.},

We also offer a pragmatic step-by-step approach together with comprehensive advice for how practitioners can implement order selection.

The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple.

	abstract = {Reveals How HMMs Can Be Used as General-Purpose Time Series Models Implements all methods in RHidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R applies hidden Markov models (HMMs) to a wide range of time series types, from continuous-valued, circular, and multivariate series to binary data, bounded and unbounded counts, and categorical observations. It also discusses how to employ the freely available computing environment R to carry out computations for parameter estimation, model selection and checking, decoding, and forecasting. Illustrates the methodology in actionAfter presenting the simple Poisson HMM, the book covers estimation, forecasting, decoding, prediction, model selection, and Bayesian inference. Through examples and applications, the authors describe how to extend and generalize the basic model so it can be applied in a rich variety of situations. They also provide R code for some of the examples, enabling the use of the codes in similar applications. Effectively interpret data using HMMs This book illustrates the wonderful flexibility of HMMs as general-purpose models for time series data. It provides a broad understanding of the models and their uses.},

	abstract = {A novel algorithm for the detection of ﬁxations and smooth pursuit movements in high-speed eyetracking data is proposed, which uses a three-stage procedure to divide the intersaccadic intervals into a sequence of ﬁxation and smooth pursuit events. The ﬁrst stage performs a preliminary segmentation while the latter two stages evaluate the characteristics of each such segment and reorganize the preliminary segments into ﬁxations and smooth pursuit events. Five different performance measures are calculated to investigate different aspects of the algorithm’s behavior. The algorithm is compared to the current state-of-the-art (I-VDT and the algorithm in [11]), as well as to annotations by two experts. The proposed algorithm performs considerably better (average Cohen’s kappa 0.42) than the I-VDT algorithm (average Cohen’s kappa 0.20) and the algorithm in [11] (average Cohen’s kappa 0.16), when compared to the experts’ annotations.},
